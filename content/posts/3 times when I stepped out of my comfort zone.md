It is so easy to get caught up in your routines.

That way life flies past you. And you won't even notice! Until you look back 10 years later with regret.

Wouldn't that be a sin?

When you step out of your comfort zone you will:

- Gain more confidence
- Meet cool people
- Do stupid things

> If you do what you always did, you will get what you always got.

## How to step out of your comfort zone?

If you think: I can't do this...

and then still do that thing. That's the moment when you step out of your comfort zone. Your heart is pounding in your throat and you're scared.

But that won't stop you.

It can be that easy! (in theory)

Yet few people dare to do this. 'What would others think of me?' or, 'that's not who I am'. Are thoughts flying through their heads.

**But nobody gives a f\*ck bro.**

All those people you're worrying about right now...

They are way too busy with themselves to even think about you for 1 second. My advice? Do your own thing!

I try to do that more and more myself.

**Stepping out of your comfort zone is hard.**

But, you can get better at it by doing it more often. What is something that you are afraid to do right now that is holding you back? Do that as soon as possible.

Without hesitating!

In these moments I felt like the main character of my life:

## 1. Cycled 187 km in one day

It sounded like a ridiculous idea. One of my best friends felt the same way. So we decided to do it, without any training.

It took us **more than 16 hours**.

We learned a lot from it:

- How to fix a flat bicycle tire.
- That you shouldn't give up too soon.
- Your body can handle more than you think.
- Cycling in the rain without the right jacket sucks.

To this day, some people don't believe us when we tell the story.

## 2. Jumped off a cliff in Greece

All the boys had a terrible hangover. We were seasick after a 3-hour boat trip (in the blazing sun). And then arrived at a high cliff (12m).

The captain stopped the ship.

We swam to the cliff.

Then had to do a whole scramble. Everyone wondered if it would be safe. Once at the top, I doubted going back.

Then I looked over my shoulder.

Two **smoking hot blonde girls** didn't dare to jump.

So, of course, I had to show them how it's done. Once I jumped and was almost flying through the air, I got the best feeling ever.

Adrenaline level 100%+!

## 3. Sparring for the first time

A friend of mine is crazy about martial arts. He tried for a long time to persuade me to come along. I doubted whether kickboxing is even something for me.

'I'm not really much of a fighter.'

Wrong.

**I was scared.** I thought I would come home with a black eye. I knew I shouldn't listen to that little voice in my head.

So I went anyway!

Everything was new to me.

It was a tough workout. And I had to take some beatings. Yet I have never felt so fulfilled.

I proved to myself that I should trust my gut feeling!
