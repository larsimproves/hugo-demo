## My story

I used to be shy myself.

I didn't dare open my mouth and wanted to please everyone. If I'm kind enough, everyone will like me! That's what I thought, but nothing could be further from the truth. **People walked all over me**, they ridiculed me which made me feel insecure.

I went to the club with my friends and the girls there rejected me most of the time. They thought I was weird. And I don't blame them! I wanted to do everything I could to please them. And it didn't stop there.

When I saw videos about cold approaching it went downhill.

I decided to go up to random girls who look attractive only to ask for their phone numbers. You can guess the result…

Still, I was so pumped when I managed to score a number. But after sending her the first message, it turned out that she had a '*boyfriend*'. Hmmm. I wasn't that naive after all.

Things are different now.

- I go out, talk to new people, and try to socialize with everyone.
- People no longer see me as an insecure wallflower.
- Handling social situations is my second nature.

You can imagine that this lead to a better social life, more friends and even meeting cool people.

**In this guide, I explain exactly how you can achieve the same.**

It's easier than you might think, so bare with me!

Let me be your guide.



## Introduction

### Social skills are important 

Social skills are my biggest asset nowadays. I wouldn't be anywhere without them. These tools are **necessary** if you want to grow on your self-improvement journey. That way you can learn a lot from others. Too, as humans, we need social connections. Something completely absent in recent years due to terrible lockdowns.

Besides, we live in an era where everyone is on their phone all day long. You walk into the gym, and the average gym bro seems busier with his phone than with his actual workout. 

### The benefits of being more social

Improving your social skills is not only a good addition to your self-improvement journey. It is of utmost importance. If you sit at home all day watching YouTube videos about 'picking up girls', nothing is going to happen! You might even read some interesting books such as: 

- [Men, Women & Money](https://www.amazon.com/Cold-Hard-Truth-Women-Money/dp/1476734445/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1N9B90JOB0IXZ&keywords=men+women+and+money&qid=1680444522&sprefix=men+women+and+mone%2Caps%2C347&sr=8-1)
- [The Art of Seduction](https://www.amazon.com/Art-of-Seduction-Robert-Greene-audiobook/dp/B00X0TKYKE/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1M1ZZYQV1KQIC&keywords=art+of+seduction&qid=1680444420&s=audible&sprefix=art+of+seductio%2Caudible%2C157&sr=1-1)
- [The Game](https://www.amazon.com/The-Game-Neil-Strauss-audiobook/dp/B002DN9I1Y/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3BW711JPGOCHH&keywords=the+game+neil+strauss&qid=1680444397&sprefix=the+game+neil+strauss%2Caps%2C162&sr=8-1)

But if you don't put these lessons into practice, you will remain the same loser. It's about time to take matters into your own hands. Because of my social skills, I have:

- Made new friends with people I had never spoken to before
- Had a lot of cool conversations with complete strangers
- Boosted my confidence when talking to girls

### Do you face these social obstacles?

Bro, I'm sure we're not much different.

I used to be like you. I saw a pretty chick in the club and didn't even dare to approach her. "*I'm too ugly for her anyway.*" Or "*She must already have a boyfriend.*" Were then thoughts that haunted my head. And that is not surprising at all.

Nowadays everyone is active on social media. And that **f\*cks with your mental health**. You get a distorted picture of society. Everything seems to be under a magnifying glass. On social media, all the guys look like fitness influencers. Deep down we all know that all those dudes only look this pumped up with lots of filters and good lighting.

You might be well aware of this. But your subconscious mind still compares you to these influencers.

Also, chicks nowadays have 1000+ matches if they swipe on Tinder for a day. They have more options than ever before. 

As a modern man, it seems almost impossible to distinguish yourself from the rest. But don't be afraid. The answer is simple. (*I'll share it with you in a minute!*). Before you read on, I want to emphasize that you don't have to be handsome, tall, or rich to build good social skills. Although, I can say from personal experience that it might help to look a bit like Brad Pitt.

## Build an aesthetic body

### Should you go to the gym?

It's actually quite simple. In most cases, **you don't dare to talk to anyone because you don't feel confident in your own skin**. Look in the mirror bro. Do you like what you see? There are many things that you cannot influence yourself. But if it looks like you're 2 months pregnant, trust me bro, you can do something about that.

By going to the gym 2-4 times a week you build up an unprecedented part of self-confidence. After all, you get behind the wheel yourself!

### Going to the gym gains respect

Now that you're working out on a regular basis, others see that you take pride in your appearance. And that ensures that they respect you way more. Now you are no longer the pathetic little fellow who walks with his shoulders down. 

Chest forward, and chin up. You walk the world like you're the man. That's exactly how you feel when you leave the gym. And you also radiate that energy!

> "It is a shame for a man to grow old without seeing the beauty and strength of which his body is capable.” - Socrates.

You feel in charge of your own body. You know like no other that your body is a work of art and you are the artist. Every day you carve a small piece out of that giant block. 

## Become an interesting person

I covered the basics to improving your social skills. 

You can still become a social butterfly as a skinny kid. But having (somewhat of) an aesthetic body will work wonders. 

People immediately look your way when you walk into the room. It may not feel like it to you, but others can see that you are fit. And you radiate that!

What's your plan now? Talk for hours about how much you can bench press and how much chicken you eat? Don't think so brother. It's about time to become an interesting person.

### How to become an interesting person?

It might sound harder than it is.

What am I supposed to talk about? That's the easy part: about everything except yourself. **The world does not revolve around you.** Of course, your world is about you. But someone else's world, right, it only revolves around them.

People love talking about themselves. Luckily you know better!

You are now using this as your superpower. You show interest and that makes others think you are interesting. Do you find it difficult to keep a conversation going? Then I've got a golden tip for you.

### Golden tip: the 5 W’s!

Sometimes it can be difficult to keep a conversation going. Don't stress bro, we all know how embarrassing social interactions can be. Next time use the 5 W's. Who, what, when, where, and why. Focus on the topics the other person likes to talk about, try to ask questions, and show real interest.

Showing interest is rare these days.

You'll be head and shoulders above the rest if you do this. And the great thing is, you get to hear many more cool stories. You got 2 ears and 1 mouth for a reason. Yet at some point, you need to share some things about yourself.

### What could you tell about yourself?

To have a fluent conversation, it is of course important that you have a cool life to talk about.

Chances are that you have already made many more friends after this social guide. You have already gone to the gym and experienced many social interactions there as well. Besides, you no longer live on your smartphone. This will already make you more interesting than those who do. Now it's time to become an even more interesting person. How do you achieve that? 

By becoming a lifelong learner.

Where others stop learning after high school, you decide to never stop.

- You study interesting books
- You listen to podcasts
- You read blogs

You want to know a little bit about everything. In that case, you will have a few topics to talk about in every conversation. And besides that, you will also become a lot wiser yourself. Start by trying new things and reading these books: 

- [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://www.amazon.com/How-Win-Friends-Influence-People/dp/B09KT5CRL6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=289MB7UW85WMX&keywords=how+to+win+friends+and+influence+people+book&qid=1680438747&sprefix=how+to+wi%2Caps%2C160&sr=8-1)
- [Listen Like You Mean It](https://www.amazon.com/Listen-Like-You-Mean-Reclaiming/dp/B08D6ZP4F1/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3W1B090S32MK0&keywords=listen+like+you+mean+it&qid=1680438818&s=audible&sprefix=listen+like+you+mean+i%2Caudible%2C142&sr=1-1)
- [How to Talk to Anyone](https://www.amazon.com/How-to-Talk-to-Anyone-audiobook/dp/B013GXDRKC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2GNIB4BC2SF00&keywords=how+to+talk+to+anyone&qid=1680438777&s=audible&sprefix=how+to+talk+to+anyon%2Caudible%2C151&sr=1-1)
- [The 48 Laws of Power](https://www.amazon.com/48-Laws-Power-Robert-Greene/dp/0140280197/ref=sr_1_1?crid=36NTQXZOH610D&keywords=48+laws+of+power+by+robert+greene&qid=1680438710&sprefix=48+laws+%2Caps%2C228&sr=8-1)

Don't read all of them. **Pick one of these books and study it thoroughly.** Then, try to implement all the lessons you've learned in real life. That way you will be a social mastermind in under 6 months! 

## Develop your social skills

The tips may have seemed obvious until now. You could have figured this out yourself. But let me ask you one thing. **Why are you still reading then?** I know you want the golden secrets to becoming a master of social skills. I'm gonna help you, bro. These small tips can make a big difference DIRECTLY. (*In the next 5 min.!*)

### Don’t focus on the outcome

Do you know why you never dare to start a conversation with someone else?

You are too fixated on the outcome. 

You fear rejection even before you start the conversation. I was like that myself. I once approached a chick, only to ask for her number. What do you think? She thought I was a complete weirdo! I was only focused on the outcome; get her number and brag about it to my friends.

You should focus on the conversation itself. Your intention should be: I'm going to have a chat and I'll see where it will get me. Then you won't come across as an insecure *sshole anymore. Besides, this way you can show much more interest and you come across as more confident.

### Hold eye-contact

It's not rocket science. Before you strike up a conversation with someone, make sure you make eye contact. 

It is also important to maintain eye contact during the conversation. This will make you appear much more confident. You are not afraid that others might have an opinion about you. One tip is to focus on one eye. This often comes across as a bit more natural. 

### Take it slow

Slow. The. F*ck. Down.

Especially when talking to girls, it's important to talk slowly. If you talk fast, it will come across as if you have to keep her attention by talking. You feel that your conversation is not interesting enough. That's why you want to tell everything as soon as possible because you think your "talking time" is almost over.

Calm down homie.

That girl will still be there in 3 minutes. And if not? No problem. Her loss. You are no people pleaser. You only want to talk to people who also want to talk to you. So it's best to talk in a calm manner.

Next time, try to be quiet for a while after a sentence. Assert your dominance.

### Hands out of your pocket

We don't live at the North Pole.

If you're messing around with your hands in your pocket all the time, no one will respect you. It seems like you are not interested in the other person. Some even find it rude. 

When you have your hands out of your pockets, you look much more approachable to others. You can immediately shake a hand and automatically have a much more open posture. Easy peasy.

## Grow your social network

You now know exactly what you should (and shouldn't) do to unlock great social skills.

But staying in your room all day results in you wasting your potential. It's time to get out and about. Out into the wide world. Leave your smartphone at home more often. And talk to more people.

### Where to meet other people?

Where could you meet all these new people?

Exactly in the places where you prefer to be yourself.

- Do you love to party? Then you will meet like-minded people in busy nightclubs.
- Would you rather go to the gym? Then you can also meet plenty of people there!

the advantage is that **you meet like-minded individuals at spots you hang out yourself**. Too, it is easy to start a chat with them because you have been to this place before. "*Wow, it's never this busy here.*" Another good opener is "*Doing cardio today?*" (for the gym, in the club it can come across as a bit strange...).

### The blonde at the bus stop

These places are a nice start. But remember, **the world is your playground**. You can meet cool people everywhere. As long as you have the right mindset. Don't focus on the outcome. You can meet the girl of your dreams at the bus stop, as happened to me… (sort of)

I had finished my exam and had to wait for the bus home, for fifteen minutes. Then a stunning blonde girl came walking toward me. 

> We looked at each other and I was too scared to open my mouth. 

After a chaotic discussion in my brain, I decided to gather all my courage. I didn't know what to say at all. Wouldn't she think I was a freak? The best thing I could come up with was: "*Pfff do we really have to wait another 15 minutes?*".

When that sentence escaped my mouth I sank through the ground. 

But what followed was a nice conversation! 

We talked a bit about school and sports. The good news is that after 5 minutes she still wasn't weeping (*could you imagine?!*). In contrast, she kept the conversation going herself! Long story short, she was already dating someone.

**But my 'social skills XP' went up by 10%!**

And this cute blonde even said that she **felt flattered** that I asked her out. 

## Become a modern Casanova

In which case are you successful with women?

Everyone's got their own take on this, and it's causing some serious disagreement.

- One treats dating like an extensive buffet and wants to taste everything.
- While the other prefers to save to dine at a 5-star restaurant.

One thing is for sure, at some point you have to start the conversation. Your looks might ensure that you have one foot in the doorway. But your mouthpiece has to do the rest of the work!

Where do you meet all those women?

I get it. This will be awkward. Especially since you don't get the right example.

### How do I get success on dating apps?

Your friends brag about their **20+ Tinder matches**. But you know better. First, these desperate boys often have ugly matches with girls that are just "good enough". But that's not you.

I've been on Tinder for a long time myself. Believe me bro, it's not worth it. It takes a lot of time. Also, women always have more choices than men in this current day dating world. You try so hard to become the best version of yourself. But that is often difficult to show in a few photos.

Is that the way you want to 'score a chick'?

No.

It is much wiser to **seduce them in real life**.

Before you buy a car, you want to take it for a test drive, don't you? Then a 3D simulation on the internet is not enough. The same is true for your dating life!

### Be different

99% of men use dating apps (*it could be a little less, but you know what I mean*). Which men nowadays still dare to approach a beautiful girl? They're way too f*cking scared about what their mates will think if they get rejected. Put your ego aside bro.

> I'd rather get rejected in person than score a match with a hot babe on a dating app.

By approaching women in real life you have a big head start on the rest. She immediately realizes that you are not a wimp. You are the big boss who goes out into the world and takes what is his.

### Don't cold approach: do this instead!

YouTube videos about cold approaching often seem promising. But cold approaching is weird bro (and cold). Do you know why you're not successful with women? This is your tactic:

> "Hey you look nice, can I have your number?"

That's not going to work. Unfortunately, I found this out too late myself. It's a better idea to have a chat with someone and see where you end up from there. Then you will see for yourself whether she is worth asking for her number at all.

After all, looks are only half of the equation.

What if she foul-mouthed her mother? Or deep down is a pure b*tch? You don't want to go on a date with a girl like that, do you? So don't fixate on looks and first try to find out how she behaves in everyday life. For example, see how she treats the waiter at a restaurant. Or how she engages with others.

That way, you can filter out the worthy girls right away.

Always remember not to settle for just her social media handle. If she's only willing to give you her Snapchat, it might be best to move on. After all, which mature woman still primarily uses Snapchat? We're not in elementary school anymore.

### You got the number, what’s next?

Con-f*cking-gratulations.

You got that hottie's number and now you feel like the time you got your swimming certificate. 

Now the real work begins. Time to take action. You don't want to be a simp and chat with her for days on end.

You are a busy guy. You go to the gym, read books and try to get your life in order.

Then you can't text with a girl all day, can you? You are on your purpose and have responsibilities. You want to schedule a date as quickly as possible and then get back to business.

### She lefts me on read…

You asked her if she wants to go on a date with you. But she doesn't respond. Do you know why? Women make decisions based on their emotions. The conversation you had with her the other day gave her certain feelings. She saw that you were confident and not afraid to talk to her. And now? You only send her a message. This doesn't stir any feelings in her heart. 

My advice?

- Call her
- Send a voice memo

This sets you apart from the rest. She understands that you are not an insecure mess. Sending a chat message is super safe. You can spend hours thinking about what you are going to send. And besides, she's already forgotten about you. Remember: she has 100+ Tinder matches that give her attention all day long.

By calling your potential date you avoid a lot of problems. She cannot leave you 'on read'. 

**You call her, say you enjoyed meeting her, and ask if she wants to meet again.**

That's it. If she doesn't pick up the phone, her loss. You got better things to do homie! If she likes you she will call you back.

Don't feel like calling her? You can also leave a voice memo. That way she has a little more time to think about a time for a date.

### Attention is your currency

You want to make sure that you don't spend all day behind your smartphone to keep the conversation going.

You want to get away from that smartphone. And meet her in real life as soon as possible.

- Women pay with beauty.
- Men pay with attention.

Still don't get it? All those guys on Tinder give her "free attention" all day long. She didn't have to do anything for it. They give her all the attention because they only have one goal in mind. Her beauty (and all other dirty things you can imagine). You know better. You don't give your attention away for free. 

Otherwise, you might as well book a one-way ticket to the friend zone right away. 

Besides, you are a man with high standards. You can't settle for a girl that only 'looks good'. You want a girl that treats you like a king. 

### Remain mysterious

It's a good idea to stay a little mysterious.

If you immediately show all your cards, there will be no (sexual) tension anymore! I'm not saying that you should lie. But you don't have to tell everything all the time. You have a life of your own too. That is privacy and is precious these days, protect it at all costs.

If you stop telling everything about your personal life, you will become way more interesting. If she doesn't know exactly what you're up to on a regular basis, she will fill it in for herself. You will become her fantasy and she will never stop thinking about you. 

And that will only work in your favor. (thank me later bro)

## Simple advice

In this guide, I've listed everything I've learned about improving social skills.

I'm not saying it's easy to become more social.

On the contrary, I'm learning everyday myself too!

It's a skill, a kind of muscle, and **you have to train it every day**. Only then will you ever become “good” at it. Keep in mind that everyone's human and no conversation has to be flawless. Embrace imperfections.
