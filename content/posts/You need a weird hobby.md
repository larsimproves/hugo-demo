# You need a weird hobby

Trust me when I say that I've had a lot of weird hobbies. 

- I filmed videos for many Youtube channels.

- I recorded my own podcast episodes.

- I learned to solve a Rubik's Cube.

- I read 80+ self-help books.

- I write blog posts. 

You could say I am a total geek. But these hobbies taught me a lot. First of all, to succeed in these interests you need discipline. And patience. Lots of patience. There were a lot of times when I felt like giving up. In hindsight, I am so thankful that I didn't. Reaching mastery, in anything, takes effort.

In this current world, it's preached to focus on the end goal. Everything we do has to have a certain purpose. Work hard so you can earn X amount of money. Or work out to get a dream physique. In your mind, you create a desire for the outcome. I love Naval's definition of desire: 

> Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.

The whole point of a hobby is to appreciate the journey. Do things you like for the sake of it. If you feel out of touch with your new pursuit, stop. There are so many things out there you could try, delayed gratification doesn't exist in this case.

- Write poems to seduce a non-existing lover.

- Go outside and take beautiful photos. 

- Learn to speak a new language. 

- Design your own website. 

- Brew your own coffee. 

Don't feel obligated to turn your passion into a side hustle. Keep your weird hobby to yourself. 

Or don't. 

Tell others about your hobby with a sense of pride. 

They might take a piss out of you. 

You don't live your life for them.
