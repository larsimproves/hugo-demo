1. Make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no.
2. It is far better to have understood why you failed than to be ignorant of why you succeeded.
3. The degree of the pain will be proportional to the price you will be able to charge.
4. **The point of good writing is for the reader to understand. The point of good persuasion is for the prospect to feel understood.**
5. There are three main markets that will always exist: Health, Wealth, and Relationships.
6. No one can serve two masters.
7. If your offer doesn’t work, it doesn’t mean you suck. It means your offer sucks. Big difference. You only suck if you stop trying.
8. Charge as high a price as you can say out loud without cracking a smile. (Dan Kennedy)”
9. The reason people buy anything is to get a deal. They believe what they are getting (VALUE) is worth more than what they are giving in exchange for it (PRICE).
10. **When you raise your price, you increase the value the consumer receives without changing anything else about your product.**
11. Those who pay the most, pay the most attention.
12. You need to have a big discrepancy between what something costs you and what you charge for it. It is the only way to be unreasonably successful.
13. The Grand Slam Offer only becomes valuable once the prospect perceives the increase in likelihood of achievement, perceives the decrease in time delay, and perceives the decrease in effort and sacrifice.
14. The only thing that beats “free” is “fast”. People will pay for speed.
15. **Decreasing the effort and sacrifice, or at least the perceived effort and sacrifice, can massively boost the appeal of your offer.**
16. You must resolve every obstacle a buyer believes they will have to convert the highest amount of people.
17. People want what they can’t have. People want what other people want. People want things only a select few have access to.
18. Hormozi Law: The longer you delay the ask, the bigger the ask you can make. “The longer the runway, the bigger the plane that can take off .”
19. **The person who needs the exchange less always has the upper hand.**
20. Whenever trying to close a deal, never discount the main offer. It teaches your customers that your prices are negotiable.
21. Reversing risk is the number one way to increase the conversion of an offer.
22. The key is to identify a client’s biggest fears, pain, and perceived obstacles. What do they not want to have happen if they pay you?
23. **Implicit-egotism effect: we are generally drawn to the things and people that most resemble us.**
24. What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.
25. Most people don’t even notice an offer on the first mention. That’s why you need to create new creative (videos, images) and new hooks, stories, and copy around the same offers.
26. What makes a guarantee have power is a conditional statement: If you do not get X result in Y time period, we will Z.
27. **Fear of loss is stronger than desire for gain.**
