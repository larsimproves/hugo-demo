Nowadays you can learn all kinds of new skills.

That's what I did with [these 5 projects](https://www.larstendolle.com/projects-lessons/). The internet allows you to learn from experts for free! Yet that information is often boring and difficult to understand as a beginner.

This week I taught one of my friends how to work out.

Running on a treadmill is simple.

But you can't learn all exercises by only watching YouTube tutorials. It is more useful if someone helps you in real life and gives tips. Someone who can also motivate you!

That's why I like to learn things from other beginners.

They often use easy language to explain complex concepts.

And share lessons they have learned themselves. They can still remember being at the same point as you. You immediately get the feeling: if this person can do it, I can do it too!

When taught by experts, this is often not the case. You are more likely to feel overwhelmed by the difficult words they use. 

I was able to teach my friends a lot as a beginner:

- How to set up a WordPress website
- How to form good habits
- How to benchpress

Often you don't need professionals at all to learn things from. You need a helping hand from someone **1 level above you**.

What can you teach someone else?
