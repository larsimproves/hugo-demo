I love to try new things.

Before starting this blog, I tried many side projects. I learned a lot from those! You can also try them out (for free) this week.

Try one at a time.

Get stuck into the project for 3 months.

Watch many YouTube videos per subject. Read long-form content. Dare to ask others for help.

Then you will be an expert in no time!

## 1. YouTube-channels

I was saving money for over 6 months.

Until I could buy the same camera as Casey Neistat. The Canon 77D. Besides, I learned to use Final Cut Pro X.

I have had over 3 YouTube channels.

In my prime time, I even had **800+ subscribers**!

I made vlogs, sketches, short films, and even educational clips. But I didn't like the fact that everyone could watch these videos. So I made them all private.

I still look back with beautiful memories!

### I learned:

- Choosing the right music
- Capturing attention
- Making thumbnails
- Writing scripts
- Video editing
- Storytelling

## 2. Personal Dutch blog

I read 80+ self-help books

And shared the coolest lessons on a Dutch blog. This had to be a big success! I paid $30,- for hosting and a site.

I even published 45+ posts.

After 4 months I had 30 monthly visitors.

That was me, visiting the website many times per day. I felt miserable. Why was no one watching?

Then I started an English blog!

### I learned:

- Writing without fluff
- Picking cool subjects
- Staying consistent
- Content creation
- Google Analytics
- WordPress
- SEO

## 3. Designing In Adobe Illustrator

I love minimalism.

Most online logo generators don't understand that. So I decided to go for it myself. From YouTube banners to logos, I made everything!

Half of the creations were ugly.

Everything else was decent!

I learned to transform my thoughts into 2d creations. I'm not a design pro, but I had a lot of fun creating these projects! You should try it too.

It is calming to learn Adobe illustrator!

### I learned:

- Turning face into animation
- YouTube-banner creation
- Crafting Insta-carrousels
- Designing animations
- Making podcast art
- Making 3D logos
- Being creative

## 4. Hosting a podcast

I don't like to show my face online.

In my YouTube videos, I wanted to look perfect. That was not necessary with a podcast! I plugged the microphone into my MacBook and started talking.

Later I even started writing small scripts.

There were also guests passing by.

They taught me all kinds of things about investing and entrepreneurship. I also learned to keep the conversation going. And how to ask better questions!

A great learning experience.

### I learned:

Putting the episodes on Apple Podcast

- Engaging an audience via stories
- Reaching out to potential guests
- Setting up a microphone
- Editing audio fragments
- Making a podcast intro
- Scripting episodes
- Garageband

## 5. Becoming A Blender 3D artist

Animated movies always look so imaginative!

I often see life as a movie too. I wanted to turn these fantasies into animations! Then I discovered Blender.

A free 3d software.

I watched 20+ hours of Blender tutorials.

I tried to recreate all the 3D models. That was quite difficult in the beginning. But the designs were definitely worth the hard work.

You do need a fast computer.

### I learned:

- Transforming a model into animation

- Creating 3D mock-ups of a person
- Exporting 3D objects to JPEG
- [Downloading Blender](https://www.blender.org/) for free
- Making objects in 3D
