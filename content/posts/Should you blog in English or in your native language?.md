For the last 2 years, I've written over 1800+ articles. 

I started multiple blogs in Dutch because this is my native language. **Blogging in English seemed way too hard.** 

I thought readers would struggle to read my posts because of grammar mistakes. 

Still, I dared to take the leap. 

When sharing all kinds of writing tips on Twitter, everybody thought I was a native speaker! To become good at writing online, use short sentences. A 12-year-old should be able to understand it. (most readers, except mine, are not as smart as you would think)

## Why blog in English? 

There are several reasons why you should consider blogging in English as a non-native speaker. For example: 

- You have to think thoroughly about every word you write. 
- It's easier to reach like-minded people on a niche topic. 
- You can reach a broader audience. 
- Create more opportunities. 

Still, I understand why you might want to blog in your native language. 

## Why blog in your native language? 

These are a few reasons why I doubted writing my blog posts in English: 

- You could lose the audience in your native tongue. 
- Writing in English takes way more time.
- You are afraid of making mistakes.  
- It's harder to stay consistent. 

After giving both a try for a great period, I came up with the following conclusion. 

## In conclusion: 

- If you want to write to create a lot of opportunities for yourself, try writing in English. You will reach a way larger audience. But at the same time, it's also **easier to find a niche audience**. 

- If you solely write for the sake of it, to relieve stress, or to enjoy writing as your hobby; stick with your native language!

When you want to earn a lot of money by writing online, do some market research. What is the language your audience speaks? You should probably go for this language!

**Never settle down for your native language because you are afraid of making mistakes when writing in English. That's what cowards do. You're not like them.**
