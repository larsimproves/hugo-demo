These days, it seems almost normal to turn your hobby into a side hustle.

For example, if you've started a new creative hobby, at the next party you'll hear "You should try to sell this!".

When your hobby is painting you will get comments like:

- 'Do you also make paintings on commission?'
- 'You could ask X amount of money for this!'
- 'Ever thought of selling your paintings?'

While you only like to play the artist every now and then.

Still, it makes sense that people would recommend this to you. 

After all, the internet has made it possible for anyone to earn money online. This creates a lot of opportunities. But might also put a lot of pressure on some creatives.

People who tell you to try to make money from your hobby project only want the best for you! They hate their own job. That's why they don't want others to make the same mistake. They try to motivate you to turn your passion into a side hustle.

Others recognize a part of themselves in you. They think that it's your dream to make money from your hobby. Because they have always wanted to do the same but never dared to. 

But is your passion still fun to do when you earn money from it? Then you depend on your passion for paying your bills at the end of the month. Don't you put too much pressure on yourself then?

> Your passion has always been a means of breaking away from the routine of everyday life. But now it has become part of it.

You will now make completely different paintings. Not because you like it yourself, but because others are willing to pay more for it.

Such a shame.

Making beautiful paintings was your passion once. But is that still true if you turn it into a side hustle?

Thus, remember that it is okay to keep your passion to yourself.

**If doing what you love makes you happy, it's more valuable than money.**

This post isn't about painting.
