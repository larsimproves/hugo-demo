In this extensive post, I will explain exactly why you should start a personal blog today! I read this [full article by Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/) and it seemed like a great idea to add a few experiences of my own!

# Introduction

So you want to start a blog? What a great idea! Chances are you've already started a big search on the world wide web because you want to start blogging as soon as possible. Or maybe you want to start a personal blog but you don't know what to write about. Don't be worried, in this post I will teach you all the tricks of the trade!

# Why am I the right person to help you?

Before we start this gigantic tour through the magical blogging world, I will first introduce myself. My name is Lars (22 years old) and I have been writing articles for about 2 years now. I have also made several websites myself. I've learned a lot about terms like SEO, backlinks, and keywords. (Don't worry, we'll keep it simple today!)

Enough about me, let's start this journey!

# Why should you start a blog?

It always seemed like a good idea to share my wild plans and cool ideas with the rest of the world. What better way to do this than with a personal blog? By writing posts about your own experiences you can help many others. These could be other reasons to start a personal blog:

- What may seem very ordinary to you right now could actually lead someone else to creative insights.
- By writing many blog posts you become very good at making your ideas tangible. When you know how to explain something to another person, the idea becomes clear to you as well.
- It can be a way to meet people on the Internet with the same interests as you! After all, your blog can be read worldwide.
- Having a blog is a perfect way to introduce yourself to others. By reading a few of your posts, they can learn more about you.

# I wouldn't know what to write about

Nowadays you can start a blog about any subject! Are you passionate about birdhouses? I'm sure there are at least 10 others interested in reading a blog about this topic. But it can be even easier.

For example, share a few links to useful sites that inspire you. I bet others would love to read this as well.

Or collect the 10 best movies you've ever seen. It can be anything, as long as you enjoy writing about it.

# Nobody wants to read my personal blog

In his blog post, Guzey tells that in the first 2 years there were not any visitors to his site. It can happen that your website doesn't show up on Google! Fortunately, as you start writing more, your blog will become more and more findable (I'll share some good tips on that later in this post). So don't let the low number of visitors deter you from starting your blog!

If you never post anything you know for sure that no one is going to read your stuff.

But if you write posts that could be helpful to others, then you probably already know a couple of people who are dealing with those problems. Therefore, they've taken an interest in your posts. Acquaintances, family members, colleagues, fellow students, you name it. Do they suddenly tell you about a particular problem they are struggling with? If so, just send them a link to your corresponding blog post!

'I got so distracted today...' (Luckily, you created a blog post containing 'the top 5 tips for getting less distracted'. Time to share this blog post!)

If just one person can be helped by a post of yours, then it's already worth the time writing it!

# Others will think it's weird that I have a personal blog

It's likely that most of the people who find it odd that you have a blog are 80 years old (or even older). They have barely experienced the advent of the internet.

It is also possible that many do not fully understand what a personal blog is. So just try to explain it to them as simply as possible. Or just let them read what you write about! Bet they'll love seeing how much you enjoy it.

# Suppose I get haters?

I've been thinking about that myself too. You start thinking about all kinds of disaster scenarios in your head that will probably never come true anyway. Think to yourself: what's the worst that could happen?

Gary Vee even says that he [feels sorry for his haters](https://youtu.be/H0fJkdUtpj4). After all, those haters spend their precious time on this earth giving unsubstantiated criticism to his work. According to Gary Vee, this shows that these "haters" aren't really comfortable with themselves.

On the contrary, if you try to have compassion for your haters, you don't have to care about all their opinions.

# Hasn't everything already been described once on the internet?

Your post could be just the one push that someone else needs. For example, suppose someone is considering starting a personal blog (I'm referring to you here). Is this the 10th post that finally convinced him/her to start writing online? Then the goal of your blog has already been achieved!

Besides, everyone has a different writing style and each writer focuses on a different sub-topic of a particular problem.

You could even add some **personal stories** that will breathe even more life into the topic.‌

According to author Austin Kleon, we all come up with ideas from our perspectives. And that perspective is often based on the art and concoctions of others!

> 'If you look back closely at history, many of the people who we think of as lone geniuses were part of “a whole scene of people who were supporting each other, looking at each other’s work, copying from each other, stealing ideas, and contributing ideas.' - Austin Kleon

# My blog has to be perfect before I put anything online!

Well, this is where many beginning bloggers, unfortunately, go wrong. And I am also guilty of this phenomenon. Everything had to be perfect before I even dared to publish a new post on my personal blog.

Perfectionism is a bad thing if you want to start your blog. It's great that you like to pay attention to the details, but try to let go of this in the beginning.

You may find that the post you wrote yesterday is no longer relevant tomorrow. My advice? Check the post thoroughly for spelling errors, publish it, and don't look back! As soon as you have gained more experience you can always improve these articles. But chances are you'll be over your perfectionism by then!

# Is it difficult to start writing?

Yes. Starting is always difficult. This is true for anything. But the more often you write, the easier it will be in the end. And even then:

- You'll still have your doubts about your articles.
- You'll still have writers' block from time to time.
- You'll have trouble coming up with catchy titles. (I speak from experience)

Don't put a lot of pressure on yourself, especially in the beginning. For example, only write one post a month. That way it is a lot easier to consistently write a piece of content. If you find out you really enjoy doing this, then you can even write a blog post every week.

Or, you can send out a newsletter, for example! That way, the posts don't stay up forever and you can still inspire people with the ideas you share.

# How should I start a blog? Here's how I would go about it!

I've laid out my simplified step-by-step plan for starting a personal blog. Below this list, I go a bit more into detail about it:

1. Get inspired by other bloggers.
2. Choose a site to publish your blog on.
3. Make sure you have posts that people like to read.
4. Make your posts Google-ready!
5. Think about the profitability of your blog. (or don't)

## 1. Check out the pros

The best tip I can give you to get off to a flying start as a blogger is to look up your favorite bloggers. What topics do you like to read about? Or do you have a few sites that you would immediately recommend to others?

Try to think of how your blog could be included in this list. How can you incorporate the style of these bloggers into your articles?

After all, your favorite bloggers are very good at what they do. And they probably have many years of experience as well. Look at what elements you like in these bloggers, but also think about how you would improve these articles. You can then take advantage of this by creating even better posts!

## 2. What is the best site to start a blog?

There are all kinds of providers nowadays that you can use to put together a great site. I created my website with 'Hugo'. But there are many more platforms on which you can share your content. I have listed them below:

### Beginners

**Twitter/LinkedIn/Medium** - As a beginning blogger, it might be a waste to invest money in your passion right away. Therefore, it is wise to post a few pieces on social media first. In my opinion, Twitter and LinkedIn lend themselves perfectly to this. The big advantage? There are already many people active on these platforms, who love to read about all kinds of subjects. In addition, it is easier to build a following this way. However, sharing your thoughts is a liberating thought either way. So even if you just want to start blogging on a personal site without attracting a lot of visitors, it's still a great idea!

### Beginners with a passion

[**Squarespace**](https://www.squarespace.com/) - Do you think it's important that your site looks perfect? And do you want to start selling things on your website in the long run? If so, you need to visit Squarespace. Many famous YouTubers use this site because the themes look great and the website builder is very easy to use. At the same time, this could also be a disadvantage. You don't have too much flexibility in terms of designing your own website at SquareSpace. But, if you're starting out, this is a perfect platform!

**€11,- per month**

[**Ghost**](https://ghost.org/) - The post you are reading now was originally published via Ghost. Why? First of all, I am a big fan of [the beautiful themes](https://ghost.org/themes/?tag=Blog&category=free)you can choose from. But besides that, it is super easy to send newsletters via this provider. Also, editing articles is a real pleasure on this site. On top of that, your site will be super fast if you publish via Ghost.

You can host Ghost yourself as it is open source. However, this is trickier and not easy for beginners. (That's why I won't go into this any further in this post. Google is your best friend in this case). Right now, I am using Hugo(https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/). Also open source, but this is a static site. It's a bit harder to set up, but well worth it in my opinion. This site is blazingly fast!

**$9 per month** + a few euros for a personalized domain name.

### Beginners who want to turn their blog into a side-hustle

[**WordPress**](https://wordpress.org/) - This provider is the GOAT among websites. WordPress itself is completely free, you just need to buy your hosting (about **€30,- a year**). You can then download all kinds of free themes. And on top of that, you can optimize all your articles for Google by using the ['Yoast' plug-in](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/seo/). For example, look at a few [tutorials on Youtube](https://youtu.be/F3Bi1jIJ-h8).

## 3. How do I create posts that get read a lot?

First of all, it is wise to take advantage of Google's algorithm as much as possible. In other words, use keywords that are often searched for and think about how you can provide value by using these keywords.

Think about the purpose of your post before you start writing. Why would someone else want to read it? Is it entertaining, mind-blowing, personal; you name it?

If you keep this in mind and adjust your blog posts accordingly, it will be a lot more interesting for a potential visitor to read your post.

At the end of the day, writing itself can be a cool hobby! So, don't worry too much about all those metrics. Have a bit of fun along the way. The rest will follow eventually. 

## 4. This is how you can capitalize on Google's algorithm (SEO).

There's a way you can optimize your articles for Google. That may sound very vague. I'll try to explain it to you as simple as possible:

Google preferably puts content, that it thinks is valuable for the searcher, at the very top of the search results.

You can capitalize on this by mentioning certain keywords in your post. For example, use a plugin like [Yoast](https://yoast.com/wordpress/plugins/) to do this.

It's also important that your site is very fast and that many other sites link to your website (backlinks). (As a starting blogger you don't have to worry about this.)

# How much money could I make with a blog?

It is difficult to give a concrete answer to this. Compare it to YouTubers; the more views they get on a video, the more income they get from ads. Do you post an article once a week that gets read about 1,000 times? Then unfortunately you're not going to be able to make a living from your blog. Unless, for example, you make use of sponsorship deals.

You could, for example, start a blog that is focused on one specific target group. That way it may already be easier to attract sponsors for your blog. You then write an article on behalf of your sponsor/client. This way you can earn a good amount of money from your articles.

Do you treat your blog as a complete side hustle? Then you can earn thousands of dollars per month (this takes an awful lot of work, but it's certainly possible). It just very much depends on how often your content is viewed.

# In what ways could I make money with my blog?

There are several ways you can make money with your blog. Below I list the most common options:

- **Affiliate** **links** - If you put a link on your site to a certain product, you will receive a small percentage of the purchase price when someone buys a product through this link.
- **Banners** - These are ads above, below, between, and beside your content.
- **Sponsorships** - For example, you write a post about a particular product and receive an amount of money for it from the respective sponsor.
- **Paid** **memberships** - readers pay a certain amount to see protected content. (Paid newsletter or premium articles)
- **(Digital) product sales** - By selling a (digital) product such as an E-book, course, or guide you receive income.

→ there are of course many more creative ways to make money with your blog, but these are the most common options.

# Could anyone start a blog?

Do you have a working internet connection and a laptop/desktop? Then you could already get started! In addition, it is also useful to have a good amount of creativity and perseverance. Then I'm sure you can start a successful blog!
