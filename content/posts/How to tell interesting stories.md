Do you want everyone to be on the **edge of their seats** when you start telling?

Telling interesting stories is hard.

You might think that your life is not fascinating enough at all. Imposter syndrome is bullying you! Everyone has a cool story to tell. In most cases, it's not your story that's fascinating, but the way you convey it!

Even when you go to the same amusement park with five friends. It is often only one friend who tells the most intriguing story about it. I dare to call myself an exciting speaker. I use a few handy tricks.

I try to **speak as slow as possible**. After all, I only tell stories that I am convinced others will also like! So why not take the time for that? Boring speakers talk too fast. You show that you think others will not appreciate your story.

I will also tell you all the **details**. I'm not telling a story, I'm evoking a feeling in the listener. Tell a story as if you were a talented entertainer, not a lifeless geek. Take your listeners to the moment:

- What music was playing on the radio?
- What smells entered your nose?
- What time of day was it?

The goal is to make someone else feel as if they have experienced it themselves! Many storytellers say in such a case 'you should have been there'. That's way too vague!

Instead, say something like, "If you were here, you would have done X and felt X". It's easier for the other person to identify with that! Too, you show that you think about the other person while telling your story. You **make them a co-character in the story**.

That's why it's often easier to tell a story to your friends than to a stranger. You know them better so it's easier to involve them.

It's not worth wasting your energy on people who won't even listen. To find out if the other person is paying attention, **pause**. If your story is interesting enough, they will beg you to tell more!
