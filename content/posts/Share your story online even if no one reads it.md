Do you think your story is not good enough to share on the Internet? 

Then you're not the only one. But to leave that story unpublished is a waste. I'll explain why you should share your writing.

Put aside your insecurities and reap the benefits!

**It is normal to be hesitant to press 'publish' at this point.**

You've never written anything and put it on the internet afterward. But you'd better change that soon. Right now some people crave your knowledge!

Yet there are other reasons why it is worth sharing your story anyway.

**Putting your thoughts on paper gives your brain a rest.**

It can be a great way to reflect. By thinking about your thoughts before you write them down, they become a lot more clear. You can then share these thoughts online.

Because of this public pressure, you have to articulate the ideas well.

**You can help many others!**

Even when it doesn't seem like it. If you have helped 1 person; it is already worth the effort. If you never share your story online at least you know for sure that you are not helping anyone.

That's a shame, isn't it?

**You don't have to be an expert.**

Don't hide behind your imposter syndrome. The internet is full of beginners. They prefer to learn from someone who has recently experienced the same thing.

And that's you in this case!

**As a beginner, you often avoid jargon.**

So your message is even easier for the reader to understand. You can take the reader by the hand in your adventure. Now you are a kind of guide instead of a guru.

This is what readers love!

**It also gives you more opportunities.**

Readers from all over the world can read your story. You never know who you might manage to inspire with your writing. Who knows, you may form cool connections with like-minded people. Only by pressing publish!

**The biggest advantage of all is that you build a lifelong portfolio.**

In 10 years, you can read back exactly how you thought about some things. This way you can see exactly what ideas have shaped your life. So by sharing your stories online, you have a digital 'photo/memory book' of your brain! Do you dare to take the leap?
