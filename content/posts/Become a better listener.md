Robert Greene studied some of the greatest seducers history has ever known. For this post, I would like to borrow one of his quotes: 

> Most of the time when you're dealing with people you never get a sense that they're putting themselves out and trying to think about what your interests are.

It's sad but true. 

When was the last time someone showed interest in you? As soon as they've heard your story, most immediately start talking about their own hassle. 

Showing interest in others is so rare these days. This makes it even easier for you to become a better listener! 

This is such simple advice, but it can improve your social skills in no time. 

According to Robert Greene, you could imagine everybody to be a character. They behave in a certain way because they experienced all kinds of different things. Their upbringing, the books they read, and the stories they have heard shape their way of thinking.

In your next conversation, try to unravel their character traits. Why do they think this way? What makes them tick?  

> To be interesting, be interested - Dan Koe

Become a modern-day Sherlock Holmes when starting a dialogue. 

This way it is way easier to get to know the other person. The other person will think **you** are interesting because you seem fascinated.
