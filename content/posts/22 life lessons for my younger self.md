Today I turned 22 years old.

When friends of mine have their birthday I always ask something like:

> What advice would you give your younger self?

This time it's my turn to answer this question:

## 1. Value your time

Surprise dummy...

Your time on this earth is limited. But that is not a disadvantage. You can't redo it (as far as I know).

So you have to make the most out of it!

- Take that crazy risk.
- Talk to that beautiful girl.
- Get out of your comfort zone!

## 2. Health is your most valuable asset

Those chips are tasty, aren't they?

But eating unhealthy food for too long will f*ck you up. Always put your health first. Your future self will thank you!

When all your friends rot in the retirement home, you can still do 50+ pushups.

- Work out 2-4 times a week.
- Choose a workout plan you like.
- Eat 80% healthy and 20% unhealthy.

## 3. Don't surround yourself with negative people

I feel like a million bucks most of the time.

Even with $0 in my checking account. My big secret? I don't surround myself with negative people.

Surround yourself with 4 losers and you will be the 5th.

- Do cool things to meet cool people.
- Set very high standards for yourself.
- Do the same for the people around you.

## 4. Meditate 10 min. everyday

Your mental health is super important.

Does it feel like your brain is in chaos? Probably because of all those thoughts running through your head. There is only one medicine and it's free!

Sit and shut up.

- [Download Medito](https://meditofoundation.org/medito-app).
- Follow their 30-day challenge.
- Big secret: don't stop after 30 days.

## 5. Don't compare; compete

These days it is so easy to compare yourself to others.

Try to see the accomplishments of others as motivation. Instead of seeing yourself as inferior, try to beat them. Otherwise, the chance of becoming a loser is 110%.

Jealousy is a bad trait, bro.

- Get inspired by someone successful.
- Set long-term achievable goals.
- Become 'someone successful'.

## 6. Be authentic

Everybody is different.

Yet not everyone dares to be themselves. They go after the masses and find themselves in the matrix! You're not like that, are you?

Be yourself!

- Don't change for someone else.
- Go after your gut feeling.
- Stand out.

## 7. It's better to be alone than with the wrong person

Don't chase girls.

Focus on becoming the best version of yourself. Read books, go to the gym, meditate and set achievable goals. Girls love a guy who is on his purpose.

It's not easy, but it's worth it.

- Delete Tinder.
- Get in good shape.
- Focus on your goals.

## 8. Socialize more

Most people are extremely nice.

Yet not everyone dares to start talking to you. That's why you should always initiate small talk. You'll immediately see their eyes light up!

We are social creatures after all.

- Put your smartphone away.
- Approach strangers.
- Make new friends.

## 9. Stay consistent

Form habits.

Start small and expand later. It takes about 69 days to create a habit. (*or something like that*) After that, you don't know any better and it's part of your lifestyle!

Keep going and don't stop!

- Start with baby steps.
- But don't stop walking.
- Then you'll grow!

## 10. Go to the gym

Whether you want to or not.

The gym taught me a lot about discipline and consistency. The main factors for success in life. You feel better after a heavy workout.

Besides, you meet the nicest people in the gym.

- Lift heavy weights.
- Eat like a warrior.
- Be a chad.

## 11. Take breaks

You can't be productive 24/7.

First, try to focus on some deep work (90 min). Don't look at your smartphone! And then take a break in time.

This is how you avoid procrastination!

- Do the hard work.
- You are not a robot.
- Don't burn out.

## 12. Start A.S.A.P. with creating content (online)

Sounds strange, doesn't it?

But, I'm sure you have something to share with the rest of the world. You could even make money with it. Do what you like every day, and don't worry about money.

Stay consistent and don't give up!

- Create content.
- Reap the benefits.
- Build your dream life.

## 13. Ask better questions

Do you want better answers?

Then start by asking better questions. Ask 'why' at least 5 times. Now you know exactly what you don't know.

And you will get a better answer.

- Ask 'why' 5 times.
- Ask specific questions.
- Get specific answers.

## 14. Reading is a higher form of entertainment

Don't get me wrong.

Reading books is great. But only reading and taking no action is dangerous. That's procrastinating!

Execution > reading.

- Read only the best books.
- Try to fully understand them.
- Apply what you have learned in practice.

## 15. Don't focus on money

I want to make X amount of money.

That's a step in the right direction! But in life, it is first to give and then to receive. So first think about how you can deliver value.

Worry about money later.

- Skip output goals.
- Start setting input goals.
- Results will follow!

## 16. F.O.M.O. doesn't exist

The fear of missing out is fake.

Whether you have fear or not, you're still missing out. Choose and don't look back. When in doubt between two activities, you always make one right choice.

- Go to the party.
- Or don't.
- It doesn't matter.

## 17. Discipline > motivation

Motivation is like turning the key.

Discipline is like the fuel of your car. You're behind the wheel and choose the destination. But just turning the key won't get you anywhere.

Fill up that car!

- Do the hard work.
- Especially.
- When you don't feel like it.

## 18. Invest in yourself

S&ME > S&P 500.

I never hesitate to invest in myself. That will always pay for itself 10x. After all, you never finish learning!

## 19. Work hard, play harder

Don't fill that void inside you with boring parties.

Work hard towards your goals. Only party when you have something to celebrate. And then go full blast!

Now you deserve it.

- Skip dull parties.
- Work hard on yourself.
- Party like there's no tomorrow.

## 20. Live in the moment

The past cannot be changed.

You can set goals for the future. But you can only work on those right now! Live in the present moment.

Focus on the next 5 minutes.

- You can't change the past.
- You can't change the future.
- You can choose what to do now.

## 21. Try different things

How do you find out what you enjoy doing?

By trying at least 69 things. And then fail miserably. This is how you will find out what your purpose in life could be!

Never stop discovering new things.

- Do not doubt yourself.
- You can become whatever you want.
- Just by trying that next super crazy thing!

## 22. Start now

The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.

The second best time is now. You already have everything you need to be successful. Stop wasting time and go for it.

Plant your seed.

- Follow your instinct.
- Don't listen to others.
- Prove them wrong.
