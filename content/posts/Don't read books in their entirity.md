Whenever I bought a book I felt the need to read it from beginning to end.

I believed that this was part of long-term gratification. In most cases, when you do the hard things now, you'll get greater results in the future.

With books, this is not the case.

Like Naval says: 

> I donâ€™t believe in delayed gratification when there are an infinite number of books out there to read.

He treats books like Tweets and blogposts. He skims through them and only reads the parts that seem interesting.

Try to do the same!

Your time on this earth is limited. When you decide to read all your books in their entirety, besides the money you also invest your time.

Don't make the same mistake I used to.

Right now, I buy my books in the Kindle store (about $3 each). These ebooks are way cheaper. That way, the threshold to invest in books is way lower. Also, taking digital notes and storing them is super easy!
