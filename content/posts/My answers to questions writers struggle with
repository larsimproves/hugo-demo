If you're just starting as a creative digital writer, or if you're well on your way to becoming one, everything might seem extremely overwhelming.

After gaining a lot of experience by writing over **1500+ blog posts**, I figured it would be a great idea to answer them as best as I possibly can.

I bet **your feelings of insecurity as a writer will disappear** completely after you've read all my answers to these questions:

## Question #1: What do I need to get started as a digital writer?

A working wifi-connection, a laptop (preferably a fast one), and the internal willingness to succeed!

Make sure to [start your own personal blog]: https://www.larstendolle.com/posts/start-your-own-personal-blog/ and just go for it. By doing this you'll eventually become a better writer. Besides that, you create a talent for clearly writing down your ideas.

Don't stress too much about a 'perfect start', the best day to start was yesterday!

## Question #2: What should I write about?

Write about the advice you wish someone gave you 1 year ago.

If you are an eternal student, you can become an eternal teacher! There will always be at least one person on our big planet that craves your advice at this exact moment. For example, first of all, look at one of your hobbies.

What could you teach someone else about this passion?

## Question #3: On which platform should I start writing?

Preferably on a social platform if you want to build an online audience.

As an online writer, this will probably be Twitter, LinkedIn, or Facebook. If you just like to write for the sake of it, you could also start a blog. Type about any topic you want! It might be challenging to discover what others, but why would you even care? You write because you like it yourself. 

Not to be liked by others. 

## Question #4: In what language should I start writing?

As a non-native English writer, I could advise you to just try writing it in English if your main reason is to reach a lot of people!

It might be a great burden at the beginning of your journey, especially because it isn't your mother tongue. But this way you can engage with way more people! If your target audience doesn't speak English this would be bad advice.

Just see what content gaps there are and then figure out what language most interested people speak. (you should write in this language)

## Question #5: Should I use my real name as a writer on the internet?

This is of course totally up to you!

Do you write about sensitive topics? Then you might want to use a nickname. You could always change this name later on in the process.

This might also be a good idea to conquer your perfectionism, by doing this your ego doesn't have any influence on your writing!

## Question #6: How can I conquer writer's block?

You could use different frameworks to come up with some good ideas.

By doing this you just crush your writer's block! For example:

- Share a quote
- Tweet about your favorite insights of a popular podcast-episode
- Retweet a Tweet you thought was an eye-opener

Or answer questions that your target audience is struggling with as I do here! The possibilities are endless.

## Question #7: How do I become good at writing?

By doing it a lot!

Try to write a little bit every day and you will experience exponential growth over time. You don't have to start with full blog posts in the beginning. Just start with some low-effort posts (200 words)!

Then try to write a little more each week than the last.

Besides, quality of writing is not measured by the amount of words! 

## Question #8: How important is a niche in the beginning?

Choosing a niche, in the beginning, can be essential!

This way you can focus on a specific group of readers which leads to more engagement. But don't stress too much about a niche. It will come eventually as you write more content!

Just start by making content around the topics you're interested in, the perfect niche will follow automatically.

## Question #9: Will reading make me a better writer?

Yes and no.

Reading a book is a great way to get inspired. But it's not going to make you a better writer right away. Watching your favorite sports game every weekend does not mean you will get better at that sport.

To get better at writing you just have to do it (a lot)!

## Question #10: Do likes and views matter?

No.

In my opinion, what matters most are the opportunities you can create while writing online. You'll only need one well-paying client. Besides that, not all likes and views on your posts will result in followers who like all of your content.

It's awesome to have a lot of likes and views, but to get a foot in the door you will first have to focus on valuable content!

## Question #11: How do you prevent procrastination while writing?

By setting achievable goals you stay motivated to keep on writing.

Make sure to set goals you can influence yourself (internal goals). Creating 7 pieces of content in one week is a great goal. But, 'reaching 200 followers in one month' isn't.

You can't influence this goal, it's an external goal!

## Question #12: How can I transform 1 content idea into 100?

Change the outcome.

This is a great tip I learned from [@nicolascole](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77): 'keep your audience and your topic the same but change the outcome'.

Digital writing tips for first-time authors; *to attract their first 1000 followers*.

Digital writing tips for first-time authors; *to launch a bestseller*.

By getting creative with changing the goal, your target audience probably wants to achieve, you can produce lots of pieces of content!

## Question #13: Is there a way I could monetize my writing?

There are tons of ways you can monetize your writing:

- Sell an ebook
- Create a course
- Use affiliate links
- Provide 1-1 coaching
- Work as a freelance writer
- Write scripts for YouTubers

Opportunities are endless if you're creative enough to come up with them!

## Question #14: When should I treat my creative writing as a business?

Whenever you would like to!

Just keep in mind that you approach a business differently than a hobby. Start by writing for an audience, not just for yourself. This will already make a big difference in the way you think about your writing!

Put yourself in your target audience's shoes, what do they need?

## Question #15: Is it necessary to start a newsletter as a digital writer?

It is not necessary but extremely useful to start one as early as possible.

By starting a newsletter you are no longer dependent on a social platform. In addition, most individuals don't change their email addresses that often. So they are your biggest fans for the rest of your career!

On top of that, nowadays it's **completely free** to start a newsletter.

([Revue](https://www.getrevue.co/), [ConvertKit](https://convertkit.com/), [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/); they all offer free plans!)

I am a big fan of [@Ghost.org](https://ghost.org/). Besides having a super fast website, you can also send your newsletters here. (You can even create content that can only be viewed by members of your site!)

## Question #16: Which creators should I follow for inspiration?

Start by following these creators, you won't regret it:

- [@JSpector](https://twitter.com/jspector)
- [@JonBrosio](https://twitter.com/jonbrosio)
- [@DickieBush](https://twitter.com/dickiebush)
- [@NicolasCole](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77)
- [@WrongsToWrite](https://twitter.com/WrongsToWrite)
- [@GeorgeBlackman_](https://twitter.com/GeorgeBlackman_)

## Question #17: What is the secret of going viral?

[@dickiebush](https://twitter.com/dickiebush) writes about things he wants everybody to share with others.

He asks himself: 'Do people want to screenshot this message to send it in a group chat?'. If that's the case it's exceptional content, and more likely to go viral! You didn't only solve one problem, the person who shares your message thought someone else might struggle with it too.

So you're solving problems for people you didn't even know had them.

## Question #18: How much does it cost to start writing online?

Nothing.

You'll need a laptop or smartphone but that's it! You don't need to pay for expensive courses, a lot of quality content can be found on Twitter and YouTube. Once you start making money from your writing, then it might be a great idea to invest in such courses!

It's also easier to justify these high prices as you begin to make money from your writing.

## Question #19: Where can I get royalty-free images?

These are the best websites to get royalty-free images:

- [Deathtothestockphoto.com](https://deathtothestockphoto.com/)
- [Burst.shopify.com](https://burst.shopify.com/)
- [Kaboompics.com](https://kaboompics.com/)
- [Freeimages.com](https://www.freeimages.com/)
- [Unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Lifeofpix.com](https://www.lifeofpix.com/)
- [Stocksnap.io](https://stocksnap.io/)
- [Pixabay.com](https://pixabay.com/)
- [Pexels.com](https://www.pexels.com/)

Check them all and stick with the website that fits your preferences!

## Question #20: How to connect with other writers?

There are several ways you can get in touch with other writers.

Create a Twitter account and connect with others through Direct Messages. You could also cold-mail your favorite upcoming creators. Or just comment under their YouTube videos.

My favorite way is to email a creater when I think something they wrote is cool!

## Question #21: What should I do when I think about giving up...

Chances are, it's not so much that you want to stop writing but that you've simply chosen a subject that doesn't quite fit you.

Just stop writing on this topic for at least 2 weeks. After this, you can look at your project again with fresh eyes. If you still don't like it, pick a new topic to write about.

At least this way you gave it a second chance!

## Question #22: How can I come up with interesting titles?

It might be a good idea to look at the headlines of other successful creators.

Keep in mind that your headline has to be **clear** and **concise**. Readers want to know what you have to offer before they even decide to click on the post! Another great piece of advice is to **elicit a certain emotion** from your reader.

That way, your message is likely to stick with your audience longer.

## Question #23: Do I have to plan my content?

If you want to implement a daily writing habit this is a must!

By planning your content, you won't have to worry about coming up with new ideas before your writing session begins. This can greatly lower the threshold. Which makes it even easier to keep up this habit.

For example, use software like [@Notion](https://www.notion.so/) to keep track of all your content ideas.

## Question #24: Which music will get me into the 'zone'?

These are my favorite YouTube channels for nice tunes:

- [The Bootleg Boy](https://www.youtube.com/c/thebootlegboy)
- [Sappheiros](https://www.youtube.com/c/Sappheiros)
- [Lofi Girl](https://www.youtube.com/c/LofiGirl)
- [Cercle](https://www.youtube.com/c/Cercle)
- [Blume](https://www.youtube.com/c/BLUME_Music)

I bet they can help you concentrate too. Give them a try!

## Question #25: Are there any free sites that can give me a boost as a digital writer?

Nowadays, a lot of useful websites are just free to use!

- [@Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): royalty-free images
- [@Notion](https://www.notion.so/): organize your content
- [@Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/): writing assistant
- [@Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/): sell your writing
- [@Copy.ai](https://www.copy.ai/): blog writer
- [@Canva](https://www.canva.com/): design

My personal favorites are [@Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and [@Grammarly](https://app.grammarly.com/)! Through these programs, I have been able to bring much more structure to my writing.

## Question #26: What are some great books to read before starting?

There are many books to read about writing. These are my 3 favorite books that I would recommend to online writers in particular:

- [The 22 Laws Of Digital Writing](https://amzn.to/3Rdch2b) (Dickie Bush & Nicolas Cole)
- [The Art and Business of Online Writing](https://amzn.to/3ASIVk8) (Nicolas Cole)
- [Steal Like An Artist](https://amzn.to/3RijsWY) (Austin Kleon)

## Question #27: How to directly improve your writing?

Start by using frameworks.

I like the 1-3-1 framework [@nicolascole](https://twitter.com/Nicolascole77) uses. The idea is simple, write one sentence then another 3 where you'll go more into detail about the topic you discussed in the first sentence. Finish it off with one last message.

Just like I did with all these prior paragraphs!

## Question #28: What did you wish you knew before beginning digital writing?

Volume always wins.

By writing a lot, you quickly find out what works and what doesn't. In addition, the chances of going viral are a lot higher if you have created a lot of content. Do you still feel like your content isn't good enough after a while?

Then you can always delete it later!

## Question #29: A quick idea to start a low-effort blog?

There is no such thing as a low-effort blog.

Unless you also want to reach 'low-effort' results. If you want to become successful at something you have to go for it full force! The same goes for a blog.

Pick a website platform and go for it! 

## Question #30: What would you advise for a digital writer who has already tried 100 different things?

Write down all the lessons you learned in the preceding process.

What went wrong and why? Try to answer this for yourself. Now you probably know exactly what you can do better next time.

Learn from your mistakes, don't give up, and you will eventually succeed! (I believe in you!)

## **Question #31: Could you share some cool resources for beginning digital writers?**

If you are still unsure if online writing is really for you, I would recommend checking out as much free content as possible.

Are you dedicated and would you prefer to get as many benefits as possible from writing online? Then perhaps these resources can help you. (I haven't followed all of these myself but have heard many good things about them!)

- [@joshspector](https://joshspector.com/): sells excellent content with tips for aspiring online creators
- [@typeshare_co](https://typeshare.co/): cool templates
- [@hypefury](https://hypefury.com/): creating threads

## Bonus advice!

Don't overthink digital writing.

Try to keep it as simple as possible. Stick to publishing 1 piece of content each day. Just an inspiring quote, a random thought, or even better; a full thread!

Don't beat yourself up about it, show up every day and learn as you go.
