# I started this blog because:

- Online writing is my mental outlet and brings structure to my life.
- My thoughts, ideas, and life lessons might inspire/help others.
- I love to [connect](mailto:hi@larstendolle.com) with like-minded individuals online. 
- All the famous nerds I know have their own blog...

# Me in 10 seconds

I am a student (business administration), a content marketer for an online Dutch magazine, and a lifelong learner. I spend my time working out, reading books, and creating content.
