## I started this blog because:

- Online writing is my mental outlet and brings structure to my life.
- My thoughts, ideas, and life lessons might inspire/help others.
- All the famous nerds I know have their own blog...

## Me in 10 seconds

I am a student (business administration), a content marketer for an online Dutch magazine, and a lifelong learner. I spend my time working out, reading books, and writing online.
